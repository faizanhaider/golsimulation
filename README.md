You can set board height width by inserting number and starting game

Initial board setup can be done by clicking on dead cells.

Open `index.html` for running application. Dead cells are white and alive ones are sky blue. Click on cells to change states.

I used `jasmine` for running tests. Open `TestRunner.html' for running tests.
